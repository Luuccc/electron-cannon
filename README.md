# electron-cannon theme

A smooth dark theme built mainly for C# programming. But, can obviously be used with any language, especially with a little bit of customisation.


If you would like to customise this theme, check out the colors.less file.
My comments are based on my findings in a small sample of languages, including:
.cs    .cpp    .html    .css    .js    .json    .py
So there may be a few issues with the comments, but still may help with any customisation.
If any elements appear black, check the colors.less file, it is explained.
